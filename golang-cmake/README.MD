# CMake and CLion for Go (golang; go-lang) Example Project

The following is an example project to support [Go](https://golang.org) via 
[CMake](http://www.cmake.org) in [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). 
This allows full GDB debugging from within the IDE using the built in GDB runner.

We still utilize the [IntelliJ-platform](http://www.jetbrains.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=983889) 
[Go plugin](https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin) for its built in 
syntax highlighting, and other editor functionality.

Please use at your own leisure, it has just barely been tested. However it does seem to 
work:
